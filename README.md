Wrote this small & simple program to quotify quotes with nested quotes so I don't have to manually replace each double quote with a single quote while taking notes on course readings (I might be the only one with this problem?). Also, I missed C++ :')

Doesn't work for doubly+ nested quotes.

Here it is in action:
